//! ## Features
//!
//! **turf will:**
//!
//! - ðŸŒ¿ transform your SCSS files into CSS with [grass](https://github.com/connorskees/grass/), right at compilation time.
//! - ðŸª´ simplify your workflow with [stylist](https://github.com/futursolo/stylist-rs/), generating unique and dynamic class names for your CSS during compilation.
//! - ðŸŽ¨ inject the generated CSS into your binary, guaranteeing quick access to your styles whenever you need them.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! For a complete runnable example project, you can check out the [leptos-example](https://github.com/myFavShrimp/turf/tree/main/examples/leptos-example)/[yew-example](https://github.com/myFavShrimp/turf/tree/main/examples/yew-example).
//!
//! ### 1. Create SCSS styles for your application.
//!
//! ```scss
//! // file at scss/file/path.scss
//!
//! :root {
//!     color: red;
//!
//!     .SomeClass {
//!         color: blue;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! > By following the link [here](https://docs.rs/stylist/latest/stylist/struct.Style.html#style-scoping-and-substitution-rule-for-current-selector) you can gain a deeper understanding of how stylist processes selectors. By understanding these rules, you can effectively utilize the dynamic class names generated.
//!
//! ### 2. Use the `style_sheet` macro to include the resulting CSS in your code
//!
//! ```rust
//! turf::style_sheet!("scss/file/path.scss");
//! ```
//!
//! The macro from the above example will expand to the following code:
//!
//! ```rust
//! static CLASS_NAME: &'static str = "<class_name>";
//! static STYLE_SHEET: &'static str = "<style_sheet>";
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3. Configuration
//!
//! The configuration for turf can be specified in the Cargo.toml file using the `[package.metadata.turf]` key. This allows you to conveniently manage your SCSS compilation settings within your project's manifest.
//!
//! The following configuration options are available:
//!
//! - `load_paths` (array of directories): Specifies the directories where SCSS files should be searched during compilation. This option allows you to include SCSS files from different locations, such as external libraries or custom directories.
//! - `output_style` (string): Defines the format of the generated CSS output. This option supports two values: `expanded` and `compressed`. Use "expanded" if you prefer a more readable and indented CSS output, or "compressed" for a minified and compact version.
//!
//! Example configuration:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [package.metadata.turf]
//! load_paths = ["path/to/scss/files", "another/path"]
//! output_style = "compressed"
//! ```

/// generates the static variables `CLASS_NAME` and `STYLE_SHEET` with default settings or the settings specified in the `Cargo.toml`
pub use turf_macros::style_sheet;
